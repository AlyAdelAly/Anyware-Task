# Anyware-Software-Fullstack-Task

# Project Description:
 NumVerify is a free API that allows you to verify the validity of a phone number and provide information about it.
 Create a full-stack application using (React and Redux) for the frontend part, and (Express.js or Nest.js and MongoDB)
 for the backend. API link: https://numverify.com/

# Frontend Part:
- Only logged-in users should be able to access the Search Page. Create a log-in button on the login page that
  allows the user to log in with any username or password. Create a Higher Order Component (HOC) called
  requireAuth that only shows the search component to logged-in users and redirects non-logged-in users to
  the login page.
- The whole challenge should be responsive and can fit to any screen size.
- The application must be built using reusable components as much as you can.
- Use CSS3 and your preferred server-side CSS pre-processing platforms, such as LESS and SASS.
- The background and foreground of the links in the sidebar must be changed to white when the mouse hovers on it.
- Prepare your application to be translated in the future using the i10n concept and packages.
- Use your favorite test library to apply unit tests and integration tests to verify your code.
- There is no restriction on the colors and the fonts. Use your own favorites. 
 
# Backend Part:
- Create a web service that will be used to search for phone number.
- Create a web service that will be used to save search result.
- Create a web service that will be used to retrieve all history data.

# Some features:
- Using TailWind Css
